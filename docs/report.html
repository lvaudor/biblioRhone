<p>Il est ainsi assez difficile de travailler sur les affiliations de manière “non dirigée”… Par exemple pour les publis Hervé et en filtrant pour garder les publis récentes (&gt;2005) on a déjà 34 affiliations formulées de manière différentes (tout est mélangé pour les différents auteurs des articles) et en fonction du champ l’info principale n’est pas toujours la même (ici pas de mention de EVS par ex.).</p>
<!-- ```{r aff_piegay} -->
<!-- aff_piegay=tib_auteur %>%  -->
<!--   filter(AU=="PIEGAY H" & PY>2005) %>%  -->
<!--   select(affiliations) %>%  -->
<!--   unique() -->

<!-- reactable::reactable(aff_piegay) -->
<!-- ``` -->
<p>Par contre on pourrait imaginer lister un certain nombre de structures (CNRS, EVS, LBBE, LEHNA, etc) et tenter de détecter à partir de cet ensemble quels auteurs/publis s’y rattachent…</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="co-word-analysis-the-conceptual-structure-of-a-field">Co-Word Analysis: The conceptual structure of a field</h2>
<p>The aim of the co-word analysis is to map the conceptual structure of a framework using the word co-occurrences in a bibliographic collection.</p>
<p>The analysis can be performed through dimensionality reduction techniques such as Multidimensional Scaling (MDS), Correspondence Analysis (CA) or Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA).</p>
<p>Here, we show an example using the function conceptualStructure that performs a CA or MCA to draw a conceptual structure of the field and K-means clustering to identify clusters of documents which express common concepts. Results are plotted on a two-dimensional map.</p>
<p>conceptualStructure includes natural language processing (NLP) routines (see the function termExtraction) to extract terms from titles and abstracts. In addition, it implements the Porter’s stemming algorithm to reduce inflected (or sometimes derived) words to their word stem, base or root form.</p>
