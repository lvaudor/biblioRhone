<p>Il est ainsi assez difficile de travailler sur les affiliations de manière “non dirigée”… Par exemple pour les publis Hervé et en filtrant pour garder les publis récentes (&gt;2005) on a déjà 34 affiliations formulées de manière différentes (tout est mélangé pour les différents auteurs des articles) et en fonction du champ l’info principale n’est pas toujours la même (ici pas de mention de EVS par ex.).</p>
<!-- ```{r aff_piegay} -->
<!-- aff_piegay=tib_auteur %>%  -->
<!--   filter(AU=="PIEGAY H" & PY>2005) %>%  -->
<!--   select(affiliations) %>%  -->
<!--   unique() -->

<!-- reactable::reactable(aff_piegay) -->
<!-- ``` -->
<p>Par contre on pourrait imaginer lister un certain nombre de structures (CNRS, EVS, LBBE, LEHNA, etc) et tenter de détecter à partir de cet ensemble quels auteurs/publis s’y rattachent…</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="rattachement-des-articles-à-une-communauté">Rattachement des articles à une communauté</h2>
<p>Quand cela est possible et en se basant sur la communauté dont fait partie ses auteurs, chaque document du corpus est lui-même rattaché à une communauté.</p>
<p>On utilise pour cela la communauté dont les auteurs du document font majoritairement partie, en appliquant une pondération selon le rang de l’auteur.</p>
<p>On attribue au <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>-ième auteur d’un document qui en compte <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> en tout un poids <span class="math inline">\(w\)</span> de</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[w=(n-k+1)\frac{2}{n(n+1)}\]</span> soit par exemple pour un document qui compte 4 auteurs des poids de 0.4,0.3,0.2 et 0.1 pour le premier, deuxième, troisième et quatrième auteur respectivement.</p>
<p>Dans le cas où la majorité des auteurs ne fait pas partie d’une communauté définie, on assigne le document à la communauté majoritaire (par exemple si 30% des auteurs font partie de la communauté Cl01 et 70% ne font pas partie d’une communauté définie on assigne le document à la communauté Cl01).</p>

<!-- ## Historical Direct Citation Network -->
<!-- The historiographic map is a graph proposed by E. Garfield (2004) to represent a chronological network map of most relevant direct citations resulting from a bibliographic collection. -->
<!-- Garfield, E. (2004). Historiographic mapping of knowledge domains literature. Journal of Information Science, 30(2), 119-145. -->
<!-- The function generates a chronological direct citation network matrix which can be plotted using histPlot: -->
<!-- ## Create a historical citation network -->
<!-- ```{r histnetwork,fig.height=10,fig.width=10} -->

<!-- net <- histPlot(histResults, n=150, size = 1, labelsize=5, verbose=FALSE) -->
